        <h1>Our Robots</h1>
        <p>
            We, A Byte Irrational, are a high school FTC team from Orlando Science Schools. 
            We have proudly been Team 15065 since 2019, making it our <strong>sixth season</strong> competing in FTC. 
            We started off with 5 members who were new to FTC and have since doubled our numbers. 
            Last season we welcomed three new members and have diversified our skills greatly as a team. 
            We have two experienced engineering mentors to guide us on our design journey, 
            Mr. Don Boughton and Mr. Stephen Whitfield, as well as highly supportive parents. 
            <br><br>
            Like our signature twindragon, we aspire to innovate and create new from old when it comes to design. 
            This season, we took on many challenges proposed by the new game field and created an original design 
            suited for effortless maneuvering and securing pixels.
